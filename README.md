## Requirements

`PeriodicFetcher` uses the [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) library. This is included as a dependency and requires not extra setup other than running the 'pod install' command.
The included Rakefile makes use of the [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx) tool by Venmo as well as [XCPretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty). Running `rake setup` will install these dependencies.

## Installation

Concurrency is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Concurrency"
```
